Changes applied:
- Removed old action-based login (worldcoin-auth.js) and its <script> include.
- Button #wldSignIn now triggers NextAuth Worldcoin OAuth:
  /api/auth/signin/worldcoin?callbackUrl=/dashboard (opens at top window to escape iframe).
- Removed ACTION_ID_LOGIN from minikit-config.js; refill/ideas actions untouched.
- Kept payments and ideas flows intact.
